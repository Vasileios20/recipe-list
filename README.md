# Recipe List

![](/documentation/images/mockup.png)

This project has been developed for the PP3 for the Code Institute. It is
a recipe library where you can store and view recipes. To store a recipe you will have to enter a name for the recipe, how many people the recipe serves, the ingredients - name, quantity and measurement type(gr, ml, units) and finally the instructions by steps. The recipes stored in a Google Sheet.

# Features

## Main Menu
On the main menu the user can choose to: 1. Create a new recipe, 2. Open recipes' library or 3. Exit the program.

![Main Menu](/documentation/images/features/main_menu.png)

### Create a new recipe
When the user selects to create a new recipe they will be asked to enter the recipe's name.

![Enter recipe's name](/documentation/images/features/recipe_name.png)

Then will be asked to enter how many people the recipe can serve.

![Serves](/documentation/images/features/serves.png)

Next will be asked to add the ingredients. First the ingredient name, then the quantity and finally the measurement type. When the user finishes entering an ingredient, the user will be asked if they want to add another ingredient.

![Enter ingredients](/documentation/images/features/ingredient_quantity_measurement_type.png)

Last the user will be asked to enter the instructions by steps. A message with each step will be printed and when finsihed, the user will be asked if
they want to add another step. If no, the recipe will be printed and the user will be asked what to do next by showing the main menu.

## Open Recipes
When the user selects to open the recipes' library, if the library is empty, a message will be printed saying that the library is empty asking to create a new recipe.

![Empty library](/documentation/images/features/test_empty_list.png)

If there is a recipe in the library, a list with recipes will be printed.

![Recipes Library](/documentation/images/features/recipes_library.png)

Here they can choose which recipe to show/print.

## Google Sheet

The app uses the Google Drive API and the Google Sheets API to connect and save the recipes in a google sheet.

![Google Sheet Empty](/documentation/images/google_sheet_empty.png)

It stores the name as a string, the serves must be a possitive integer, the ingredients in a list of dictionaries and the instructions as list of strings for each step.

# Deployment and Local Development

## Deployment
The site is deployed using Heroku. Deployed site [Recipe list](https://recipe-list-3ecfc536592a.herokuapp.com/)
* Create a list of requirements 
  * To create a list of requirements, run the following command in the terminal 'Pip3 freeze > requirements.txt'.
  * Once requirements.txt file has been updated you need to commit this and push the changes up to Github.


If you don't already have an account to Heroku, create one [here](https://www.heroku.com/).

* Go to the Heroku dashboard and click the "Create new app" button.
* Name the app. Each app name on Heroku has to be unique.
* Then select your region.
* And then click "Create app".

* Head over to the settings tab.
* In the settings click the button "Reveal Config Vars".
* In the field for key, enter PORT.
* In the field for value, enter 8000.
* Click "Add".
* In the field for key, enter CREDS.
* Go over to your workspace copy the entire creds.json file, and then paste it into the value field.
* Click “Add”.

The next step is to add buildpacks to the application.

* Click "Add buildpack".
* First select the Python buildpack and click "Save changes".
* Then select the node.js buildpack and click "Save changes". (Make sure that the buildpacks are in this  order, with Python on top, and node.js underneath).

* Go to the deploy tab in settings.
* Choose the deployment method.
* Select Github, and confirm to connect to Github.
* Search for the Github repository name.
* Then click "connect".
* Scroll down  and click "Deploy Branch".
